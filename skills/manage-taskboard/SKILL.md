description: Manage taskboard projects, issues, issue relations, and comments through the taskctl CLI. Use when Codex needs to track a new requirement, inspect project work, create or update issues, relate dependent work, add progress notes, begin work on an issue, record completion, or coordinate concurrent updates.

# Manage Taskboard

Use `taskctl` for every project, issue, and comment operation. Read [references/cli.md](references/cli.md) before choosing a command or option.

## Workflow

1. Search for an existing issue before creating one. Use `context current`, then list the project issues and compare their identifiers, titles, descriptions, and status.
   - If an issue already tracks the same requirement, append the new requirement or acceptance detail to that issue without discarding its existing scope.
   - If the work depends on, blocks, is blocked by, or is closely related to another issue, add the matching issue relation.
   - Use a parent/sub-issue relation when one requirement is a contained part of a larger issue. A child has one parent; a parent may have many sub-issues.
   - Create a new issue only when no existing issue reasonably tracks the requirement.
   - Do not create, append, or relate a tiny or trivial request that does not benefit from durable tracking.
2. Inspect the relevant project and issue immediately before changing them.
3. Create or update issues with the CLI; consume its JSON output.
   Issues created through `taskctl` are assigned to Codex Agent by default. Later CLI updates do not change the assignee.
4. Let `taskctl` attribute every issue, relation, or comment mutation to the current Codex conversation through `CODEX_THREAD_ID`. Outside Codex, pass the exact conversation id with `--thread-id`.
5. Set the issue status to `in_progress` before starting implementation.
6. Include `--if-version <version>` on every concurrent update, using the version returned by the latest read.
7. Before requesting review, verify the requested work and acceptance criteria.
8. After implementation and self-verification, always move the issue to `in_review`; never move it directly to `done`.
9. Add a comment when the issue needs a durable progress note or verification result.
10. Move an issue from `in_review` to `done` only when the user explicitly confirms acceptance or explicitly asks to mark it complete. Codex self-verification alone is not sufficient.
11. Move work that cannot continue to `blocked`, and work that will not continue to `canceled`.

If an update reports a version conflict, read the issue again, reconcile the newer state, and retry with its current version.
